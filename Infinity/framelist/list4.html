Parts of a Tree, Names and Their Functions
A tree is a tall, woody, perennial plant characterized by a single main stem or trunk that supports branches and foliage, along with a root system that anchors it and absorbs water and nutrients from the soil. Its leaves perform photosynthesis to produce energy, with the trunk and branches transporting these resources throughout the plant. Trees are vital for ecosystems, providing oxygen, stabilizing soil, and serving as habitats for other organisms</h3></i></p>
