<p><i><h3 style="color:orange;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;">A flower is
the reproductive structure of flowering plants, or angiosperms, known for its wide array of colors, shapes, and fragrances. Its primary biological function is to facilitate sexual reproduction, but it also serves as a source of nectar for pollinators and has significant cultural and commercial value for humans. </h3></i></p>
