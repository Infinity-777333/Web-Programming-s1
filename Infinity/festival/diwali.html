<p>Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is a vibrant festival celebrated by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and some Buddhists, symbolizing the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. During this time, families clean and decorate their homes with oil lamps, colorful lights, and intricate rangoli (floor art), while also exchanging sweets and gifts. The festival commemorates significant events, such as Lord Rama's return to Ayodhya, and involves worshipping deities like Goddess Lakshmi for prosperity and Lord Ganesha for wisdom. The lighting of diyas (lamps) and fireworks illuminates the night sky, fostering a spirit of joy, togetherness, and a fresh start with positivity. </p>
