Holi is an ancient, vibrant Hindu festival celebrated in the spring, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil, the arrival of the spring harvest, and the mending of relationships
. It is known globally as the "Festival of Colors" due to its most recognizable tradition of people throwing and smearing colored powders and water on one another. The festival is predominantly celebrated in India and Nepal but has spread worldwide through the Indian diaspora, with festivities lasting for a night and a day. It is a time for people of all walks of life to come together, dissolve social barriers, and celebrate with music, dance, food, and laughter.
